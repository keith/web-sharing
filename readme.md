# What's this

This is an extremely simple Menu bar application that controls apache in Mountain Lion because of the removal of the Web Sharing preference.

## Continuing development

If you find any issues with this application, or have any great ideas for feature enhancements please feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SmileyKeith), [App.Net](https://alpha.app.net/smileykeith) or via email at <keith@smileykeith.com>

### How does it work?

This application uses a somewhat hacky way to deal with administrator shell commands using AppleScript in this format `do shell script \"apachectl start\" with administrator privileges`

Web sharing uses [Sparkle](https://github.com/andymatuschak/Sparkle) for automatic updates
